# CS498_Project Sentiment - "Analysis of Social Media as a predictor for Bitcoin price volatility"
This repository will be used to hold the data and Jupyter notebook file for phase 1 of the project. 

Phase 1 of the project will be to conduct a data exploration of the cryptocurrency historical datasets to ascertain if a correlation can be drawn between Bitcoin price fluctuations and the other major cryptocurrencies. The comparison will be done using the top ten cryptocurrencies by market share. The part of the project will allow us to ascertain where the findings of the sentiment analysis is applicable only to Bitcoin or  can be generalized to all cryptocurrencies.
